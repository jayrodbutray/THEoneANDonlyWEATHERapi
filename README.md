# THEoneANDonlyWEATHERapi

## We are to build a weather API from scratch. User are to be able to search the weather for a particular city, see what city they searched for, see the current forecast and a 5-day forecast for that city, and be able to see the search history of each city to be able to click on them to re-vist the forecast in case they had forgotten for upcoming trips or arrivals to those cities.

### I can't even begin to thank the array of people that helped. After almost a month of learning and growing and guessing and getting more confident in JavaScript and pulling different API's, I was finally able to get this homework completed and the application functional. Thank you thank you to Robbert. The DM's and patience he had with me were unnmeasurable. Thank you to Michael and Nick, our TA's for the fine details towards the end. I could not have even come close to figuring this out. I did a lot of Google searches trying to learn from others and doing tutorials as well.
